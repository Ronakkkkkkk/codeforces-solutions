# Codeforces Solutions
This repository contains my accepted solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).  
Each solution is written in **C++** and stored as an individual file named after the problem (e.g., `4A.cpp`, `71A.cpp`).


## File Naming Convention
Each file is named as:
<problemID><problemIndex>.cpp
Examples:
- `4A.cpp` → Watermelon  
- `71A.cpp` → Way Too Long Words  
- `977A.cpp` → Wrong Subtraction  

This naming style keeps the repository clean and easy to navigate.
